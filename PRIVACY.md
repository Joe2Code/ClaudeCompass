# Privacy Policy

**Claude Compass** is a local-only macOS menu bar app. It is designed to keep your data on your machine.

## What the app accesses

### Local stats file
The app reads `~/.claude/stats-cache.json`, a file generated by Claude Code on your machine. This file is read locally and its contents are never transmitted anywhere.

### Anthropic API (optional)
If you choose to enter API credentials in Settings, the app makes HTTPS requests to `api.anthropic.com` to fetch your remaining message count and reset time. These requests use the session key you provide and are sent directly to Anthropic's servers — no intermediary services are involved.

### macOS Keychain
API credentials (session key and organization ID) are stored in the macOS Keychain, the system's built-in secure credential store. They are never written to disk in plaintext.

### UserDefaults
Non-sensitive settings (display mode, refresh interval, notification preferences, weekly reset schedule) are stored in standard macOS UserDefaults.

### Notifications
If you enable usage alerts, the app uses macOS User Notifications to display local alerts. Notification content is generated locally and is not sent to any external service.

## What the app does NOT do

- **No telemetry or analytics** — the app does not phone home or track usage
- **No data collection** — no information is gathered about you or sent to third parties
- **No network requests** unless you configure the optional Anthropic API feature
- **No crash reporting** — no automated error reports are sent anywhere
- **No cookies, fingerprinting, or tracking** of any kind

## Open source

The full source code is available for inspection. You can verify every network request, file access, and data flow yourself.
